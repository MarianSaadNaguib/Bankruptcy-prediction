# Bankruptcy-prediction
In the dynamic landscape of financial markets, predicting corporate bankruptcy has 
emerged as a critical area of research and practical application. Corporate bankruptcy 
happens when an organization being unable to repay its obligations. Accurate prediction 
of bankruptcy can help stakeholders take a better decision. 
This study is applied using Taiwan bankruptcy dataset, which contains historical data from 
1999 to 2009. Machine learning algorithms were applied to predict whether or not a 
company will face bankruptcy. Several models such as Logistic regression and SVM were 
applied. Additionally, ensemble learning methods are explored to leverage the strengths 
of multiple models, enhancing overall prediction accuracy. The performance of the models 
was measured using some metrics such as confusion metric and ROC (AUC).
In this study we used resampling techniques included SMOTE, and SMOTE-ENN.PCA 
is also used for dimensionality reduction. The champion model after hyper parameter 
tuning was Logistic Regression model with F1 score 0.97.
The results of this study can be used as a basic guideline for applying machine learning to 
predict the risk of bankruptcy. This will be significant for financial institutions, investors, 
and policymakers, offering them a proactive tool for risk mitigation and strategic decisionmaking.

Machine learning and power bi are used to predict the risk of bankruptcy and giving recommendations to avoid failing in this risk.
